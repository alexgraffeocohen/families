# All in the Family

## Description

All in the Family is a closed social network to use with your family. We made it as easy as possible to share photos, plan events and have conversations with family members. The application also includes custom permissions so you don't have to share your bar-hopping photos with your grandparents. Interested? Give it a try (here)[www.all-in-the-family.herokuapp.com] and let us know what you think!

## Background

We created this application because currently there is no great solution for family-sharing. Facebook is too public and Twitter doesn't give you the same immersive experience. We wanted to create something that we would use and we hope you'll enjoy it too.

## Features

* Share Photos with your loved ones
* Have conversations with real-time updates
* Create events and track them using our calendar
* Use custom permissions to only share what you want to with specific members of your family


## Usage

Create an account and see how much you enjoy having a closed social network for you and your family. Once you confirm, you'll be able to share all of your life's experiences with those closest to you.

## Development/Contribution

We love pull requests! We've made incredible progress but we would love community contributions. All we ask is that you submit tests along with your pull request so we can keep our code base clean and consistent. 

## Future

We're currently implementing several features to enhance user experience like in-app texting and custom album support. We would love to eventually create an iOS app using RubyMotion.
